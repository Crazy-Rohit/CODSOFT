# Codsoft Internship Projects
Welcome to the Codsoft Internship Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my internship at Codsoft. These projects were designed to enhance my programming skills and familiarize myself with various concepts in software development.

# Projects Included
Simple Calculator: A basic calculator application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (UI). This calculator performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To-Do List: A simple to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. The UI is built using Tkinter, providing an interactive experience for managing tasks.

Contact Book: An application to store and manage contact information. Users can add new contacts, search for existing contacts, and update or delete contact details. Tkinter is used for building the user interface.

Rock Paper Scissors Game: A classic game of rock-paper-scissors implemented in Python with a Tkinter-based UI. Users can play against the computer and see the outcome of each round.

Password Generator: A utility for generating strong and random passwords. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, and the generator will provide a secure password accordingly. Tkinter is used to create the interface for user interaction.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for all projects.

Tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package used for creating interactive UI elements.

Git: Version control system used for managing project files and collaborating with team members.

GitHub: Hosting platform for version control and project management.
